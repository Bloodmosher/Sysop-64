# SYSOP-64 - System Operator for the Commodore 64 - C64 Linux Cartridge

### SYSOP-64 is a cartridge for the C64 that uses the DE10-Nano to power new capabilities. It provides HDMI output at 1080P, a DMA engine and programming model, a frame buffer that can be overlaid on top of the HDMI C64 video output, and a full Linux OS.

## üì¢ News and Updates

- üìÉ 2025.08.11: Initial github commit
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2025.08.10: Year of Linux on the C64 video released on YouTube
- ‚ñ∂Ô∏è 2025.06.03: Introducing Sysop-64 video released on YouTube


## ‚ú® Features

#### üì∫ Video 

- üñ•Ô∏è HDMI output at 1080P  driven at a pixel clock to match the C64 for silky smooth scrolling with no lag using ISEVIC video core 1.0
- ‚è±Ô∏è Software adjusted PLL, so most users will not need to adjust the C64's clock
- üì∫ Automatically detects the VIC chip model and adjusts for PAL or NTSC as needed
- üé® Fully configurable color palette
- üîä Audio capable with SID emulation
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Modern OLED monitors and TVs work really well. Game mode can also give an extra silky feel to scrolling images.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Many IPS or TFT panels exhibit ghosting artifacts - your mileage will vary.

#### üêß Linux OS + Custom Software

- üß© Write Linux programs that run on the ARM CPU and use the C64 hardware
- üêö Console terminal shell that can be overlaid on top of the C64 video output
- ‚å®Ô∏è USB keyboard can be used with the console terminal without impacting the C64
- üñß  Network enabled for easy integration with your environment including SSH access
- üñ¥  Large storage partition for all your favorite applications, demos, and games
- üì± Menu application for choosing which software to run
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Custom binaries for C64 control (see /usr/local/bin)
- üî¥üåÄ Runs Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)

#### üß† Advanced Capabilities

- ‚ö° DMA engine and programming model facilitates easy control over the C64 from programs running on Linux
- ‚ö° C64->Linux IRQ mechanism to enable Linux programs to respond to C64 events
- üé® Synchronize color palette changes to specific VIC lines to enable more colors on screen at once, similar to the Amiga (HDMI only)
- „Ä∞Ô∏è Bus sampler with large memory buffer for recording and analyzing C64 signals
- üéº SID "spy mode" for saving raw SID data for playback and mixing  

#### üõ†Ô∏è C64 Software

- üíæ Instant loading of C64 files from Linux disk including .PRG or D64 images
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Simple 8K/16K cartridge .CRT files are supported
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More advanced cartridge support in the roadmap (e.g. bank switched, buttons)
- ‚ÑπÔ∏è Allows use of custom kernal ROM images

## üì¶ Getting Started
### Setup
- You'll need a DE10-Nano board (the MisterPi clone will also work) like [this](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&CategoryNo=167&No=1046) flashed with the provided SD card image plus the SYSOP-64 carrier board for the C-64 cartridge slot (see below).
- **For correct operation, three additional wires must be run from the CPU (_CHAREN, _HIRAM, _LORAM on pins 27, 28, 29) to the carrier board.**
- Without them you'll see a correct picture upon boot, but most programs will inevitably write to IO space with a different memory configuration than the default which will result in incorrect interpretation of the signals. 
- Use Dupont wires like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GCZV4BS) (make sure they are long enough to route outside the board), with IC mini grabbers like [these](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V1HFHRY) or similar.

### Supported Hardware
- PAL and NTSC "new" with automatic detection
- NTSC "old" and Drean machines are NOT supported at this time
- DE10-Nano carrier board gerbers and SD image are included in this repo
- **Reloaded MK2 motherboard is not currently supported**

### Passthrough Port
Most cartridges should work via the passthrough port, however some are more sensitive to the additional path length and sharing of the signals. **Make sure you have disabled the Sysop-64's IO space when using other cartridges** (remove "cmd 7" from c64init.sh or use "cmd 8" after boot). Examples that have been tested and seem to work well:
- 1541 Ultimate-II
- Backbit
- CMD Super CPU Rev 1A
- Epyx Fast Load
- Several simple game cartridges

The EasyFlash 3 is an example found to be more sensitive, e.g. some games failed to load in my testing. A future update may address this once fully understood.

### DE10-Nano Carrier
- The carrier board is even simpler than the ISEVIC's board and does not require additional hardware for video clock generation, which makes this board more approachable for builders.
- Gerbers for the DE10-Nano Carrier board can be found [here](./Boards/DE10-Nano/Carrier/). 
- A  [top plate](./Boards/DE10-Nano/Top_Plates/) is also provided to help prevent touching the board during operation, provide buttons for operation, and to indicate DMA activity via LEDs.

### üñß Shell Access and Network Setup
- The provided image contains a single user account for "root" with password set to "root", **which you should change**
- Note that the terminal shell application activated by button #3 does not require login
- The provided SD image is set to use DHCP
- To change this you'll need to locate the address assigned by your network or use a USB cable and connect via serial terminal application (e.g. PuTTY) using a baud rate of 115200
- Edit the /etc/network/interfaces file if you prefer a fixed address, see the commented example in that file. Once changed, reboot.
